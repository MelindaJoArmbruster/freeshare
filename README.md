🛋️ FreeShare

FreeShare is a mobile-friendly progressive web app (PWA) designed to match people who have furniture and other household items to give away with those who need them — all for free. Born out of a passion for building community and promoting sustainability, FreeShare enables seamless connections through location-based browsing, real-time chat, and intuitive offer management.
