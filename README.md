# Freeshare

Freeshare is a PWA platform for users to offer and search for free items within the community. Recycling items by giving them directly to another community member not only helps our communities, but it also keeps items out of the landfill. Currently, the application is centered on New York city and utilizes fictional people and items.

## Browse

Users can browse a listing of all items being offered or search items with special keywords or within a certain radius of the logged-in location. Users can also search the listings of other users seeking an item. From the listings view, users can click an item to see more detail about it.

## Chat

Once a user finds an item they would like (or finds a listing seeking an item that they have available to give), the user can initiate a chat to express interest. Chats can be retrieved even after the session ends.

## Post

After creating an account, users can also post items for offer (or post that they are seeking an item) by filling out an intuitive form. The form allows for a detailed description to be entered and for up to five photos to be included with the posting.

## Edit

Users can track their open and closed items by going to their account/profile page. There, under the heading _Open Items_ or _Closed Items_ they can edit an idividual item and see the changes reflected in the post. The user can also edit their own profile from their account/profile page.

## Map

A visitor can click a button to view the items on the area map. They can zoom in to get better detail about the location of an item. Once a user clicks on the pin for a particular item, a popup containing a link to the detailed view of that item appears.
